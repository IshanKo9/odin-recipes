    <h3>An easy and delicious Korean fried chicken recipe</h3>

    <p>Korean fried chicken, usually called chikin in Korea, refers to a variety of fried chicken dishes created in South Korea, including the basic huraideu-chicken and spicy 
    yangnyeom chicken In South Korea, fried chicken is consumed as a meal, an appetizer, anju (food that is served and eaten with drinks), or as an after-meal snack.</p>
    <p> Korean fried chicken was described by Julia Moskin of The New York Times as having a "thin, crackly and almost transparent crust".
    The chicken is usually seasoned with spices, sugar, and salt, prior to and after being fried. Korean fried chicken restaurants commonly use small- or medium-sized chickens; 
    these younger chickens result in more tender meat. After frying, the chicken is usually hand-painted with sauce using a brush in order to evenly coat the chicken with a thin layer. 
    Pickled radishes and beer (or carbonated drink) are often served with Korean fried chicken.</p>

    </ul>

    <h3><strong>STEPS</strong></h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Set a rack on a foil-lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Pour oil into a 10-inch cast iron skillet. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the skillet.
            Heat over medium-high heat until oil reaches 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), about 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, toss chicken, ginger, and salt together in a large bowl until evenly coated. Spread 1/2 cup potato starch in a shallow dish; dredge chicken to coat completely and evenly.
            Add remaining 1/2 cup potato starch as needed. Shake off excess and transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li> Add chicken to the skillet carefully, working in batches; fry until lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes.

            Transfer to the rack on the prepared baking sheet. Reheat oil between batches to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Return chicken to the skillet in batches and fry again, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Stir gochujang, oyster sauce, mirin, ketchup, fish sauce, and garlic together in a large bowl. Add cooked chicken and toss to coat. Sprinkle with white and black sesame seeds.</li>
