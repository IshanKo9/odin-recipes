    <h3>An easy and delicious Korean fried chicken recipe</h3>

    <p>Korean fried chicken, usually called chikin in Korea, refers to a variety of fried chicken dishes created in South Korea, including the basic huraideu-chicken and spicy 
        yangnyeom chicken In South Korea, fried chicken is consumed as a meal, an appetizer, anju (food that is served and eaten with drinks), or as an after-meal snack.</p>
    <p> Korean fried chicken was described by Julia Moskin of The New York Times as having a "thin, crackly and almost transparent crust".
        The chicken is usually seasoned with spices, sugar, and salt, prior to and after being fried. Korean fried chicken restaurants commonly use small- or medium-sized chickens; 
        these younger chickens result in more tender meat. After frying, the chicken is usually hand-painted with sauce using a brush in order to evenly coat the chicken with a thin layer. 
        Pickled radishes and beer (or carbonated drink) are often served with Korean fried chicken.</p>
